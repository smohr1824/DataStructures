# DataStructures
These are basic implementations of classic data structures not otherwise implemented in the core Go packages.  They are mainly intended for personal use 
in support of other projects and will therefore be implemented as needed.

The philosophy of this package is simple, clean implementations of the classic interface as opposed to adding methods because
"this is useful".
